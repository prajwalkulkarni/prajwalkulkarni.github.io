        `My interest towards computers started back when I was in 9th grade. My journey on the internet began as a blogger, back when I used to run a tech blog writing and sharing articles on everything I learned. `,
        `This helped me gain good connections amongst the fraternity and mint some money as well :P. Eventually, things got serious when I got into coding and development. I've always wanted to(still do) build cool stuff that could impact/be used by lots of people.`,
        `Initially I began developing apps and have built and published several apps for Android. Lately I've grown interest towards open source projects and often contribute to them.
        This helps be better understand different codebases. 
        I always take keen interest in learning new things and use the power of code to make this world better place.`,
